ThunderPyUtils
===========

ThunderPyUtils is a fork of RDF-PyUtils written for the thunderstorm test server. This repo serves as a test
to see what opensource backends and transparent administration can do to a server with a powerful scripting
system.

As the name suggests, the plugin is written in Python. It requires the plugins PythonLoader, Pex and WorldEdit.
